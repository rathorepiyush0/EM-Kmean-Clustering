Project Title
Clustering based on a EM algorithm and K-Means

Problem Statement
Apply EM Algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using K-Means algorithm. Compare the results of the these two algorithm the quality of clustering.

Dataset Used
IRIS DATASET

What are the required python packages?
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib

Machine Learning Algorithm Used:-
kmeans algorithm
em algorithm

observation: 
The GM using EM algorithm based clustering matched the true label more closely than kmeans.
