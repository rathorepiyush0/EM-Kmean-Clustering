# Project Title
Clustering based on a EM algorithm and K-Means
# Problem Statement
Apply EM Algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for clustering using K-Means algorithm. Compare the results of the these two algorithm and the quality of clustering.
# Dataset Used
IRIS Dataset
# What are the required python packages?
Pandas
Numpy
Sklearn
Matplotlib
# Machine Learning Algorithm Used:-
Kmeans Algorithm
EM Algorithm
# Observation: 
The GM using EM algorithm based clustering matched the true label more closely than kmeans.
# Conclusion:
From the given data visualizations graphs we can conclude that the EM algorithm gives the accurate data clusters then Kmeans Algorithm.
